                A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I 
                enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for 
                the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere 
                tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present 
                moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with.

                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a 
                    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, 
                    slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready 
                    to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about 
                    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human.
