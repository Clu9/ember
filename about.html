                A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I 
                enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for 
                the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere 
                tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present 
                moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with.
