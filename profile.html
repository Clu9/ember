                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a 
                    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, 
                    slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready 
                    to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about 
                    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human.

                    She is a self-taught neophyte cultivating artist who came back to practicing art after being lost for some time. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a 
                    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
